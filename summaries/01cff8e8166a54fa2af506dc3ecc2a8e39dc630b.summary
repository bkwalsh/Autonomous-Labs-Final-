"TITLE": "Discovery of 5-Phenoxy-2-aminopyridine Derivatives as Potent and Selective Irreversible Inhibitors of Brutonâ€™s Tyrosine Kinase",
"YEAR": 2020,
"KEY FINDINGS": "The paper describes the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of a novel series of 5-phenoxy-2-aminopyridine derivatives as potent and selective irreversible inhibitors of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). The compounds were designed to target the allosteric pocket of BTK and showed improved selectivity and potency compared to existing BTK inhibitors.",
"MAIN RESULT": "The most potent compound, 18g, showed good potency and selectivity, and its biological activity was evaluated in hematological tumor cell lines. The in vivo efficacy of 18g was also tested in a Raji xenograft mouse model, and it significantly reduced tumor size, with 46.8% inhibition compared with vehicle.",
"HYPOTHESIS": "The novel hypothesis proposed by this paper is that the incorporation of a bicyclic lipophilic group linker, such as tetrahydroisoquinoline, into the 5-phenoxy-2-aminopyridine scaffold can improve the selectivity and potency of BTK inhibitors by targeting the allosteric pocket.",
"EXPERIMENT": "To validate this hypothesis, an experiment can be designed to test the binding affinity and selectivity of compound 18g and its analogs with different lipophilic group linkers to BTK and other kinases. The experiment would require: 1) expression and purification of BTK and other kinases; 2) synthesis of compound 18g and its analogs; 3) surface plasmon resonance (SPR) or isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to measure the binding affinity of the compounds to BTK and other kinases; 4) cell-based assays to evaluate the potency and selectivity of the compounds in inhibiting BTK activity. The required equipment includes SPR or ITC instruments, cell culture facilities, and molecular biology tools.",
