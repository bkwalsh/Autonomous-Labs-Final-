"TITLE": "Activation of Notch-1 signaling pathway in macrophages to secrete PD-L1 and regulate cytotoxicity of CAR-T cells in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma",
"YEAR": 2024,
"KEY FINDINGS": "The study found that the Notch-1 signaling pathway in macrophages promotes the secretion of PD-L1, which inhibits the activity and proliferation of CAR-T cells and promotes their apoptosis.",
"MAIN RESULT": "The study demonstrated that the Notch-1/IRE1/XBP1s signaling pathway in macrophages regulates the secretion of PD-L1, which affects the cytotoxicity of CAR-T cells in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.",
"HYPOTHESIS": "The Notch-1 signaling pathway in macrophages may be a potential therapeutic target to enhance the efficacy of CAR-T cell therapy in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.",
"EXPERIMENT": {
"Title": "Inhibiting Notch-1 signaling pathway in macrophages to enhance CAR-T cell therapy in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma",
"Objective": "To investigate whether inhibiting the Notch-1 signaling pathway in macrophages can enhance the efficacy of CAR-T cell therapy in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.",
"Equipment": "CAR-T cells, macrophages, Notch-1 inhibitor, PD-L1 antibody, flow cytometer, cell culture medium, etc.",
"Steps": [
"Co-culture CAR-T cells with macrophages in the presence or absence of Notch-1 inhibitor.",
"Measure the expression of PD-L1 on macrophages using flow cytometry.",
"Assess the cytotoxicity of CAR-T cells against lymphoma cells using a cytotoxicity assay.",
"Compare the results between the groups with and without Notch-1 inhibitor."
