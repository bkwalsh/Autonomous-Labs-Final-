"TITLE": "Identification of the Direct Substrates of the ABL Kinase via Kinase Assay Linked Phosphoproteomics with Multiple Drug Treatments",
"YEAR": 2013,
"KEY FINDINGS": "The study used a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to identify direct substrates of the ABL kinase, a tyrosine kinase involved in various cellular processes. The authors employed kinase assays linked to phosphoproteomics with multiple drug treatments to identify ABL substrates and their phosphorylation sites.",
"MAIN RESULT": "The study identified 144 putative ABL substrates, including 34 that were validated in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. The authors also found that ABL prefers to phosphorylate tyrosine residues in the context of the I/L/VpYxxP motif.",
"HYPOTHESIS": "ABL substrates identified in this study may play critical roles in ABL-mediated signaling pathways, and their phosphorylation by ABL may be important for regulating cellular processes such as cell proliferation and differentiation.",
"EXPERIMENT TO VALIDATE HYPOTHESIS": "To validate this hypothesis, an experiment could be designed to knockdown or knockout specific ABL substrates identified in this study and examine the effects on ABL-mediated signaling pathways and cellular processes. Specifically:

* Equipment needed: RNAi or CRISPR-Cas9 system, cell culture facilities, Western blotting equipment, and cell proliferation and differentiation assays.
* Steps to follow:
1. Design and validate RNAi or CRISPR-Cas9 constructs targeting specific ABL substrates.
2. Transfect or infect cells with the constructs and validate knockdown or knockout of the target genes.
3. Treat cells with ABL activators or inhibitors and examine the effects on ABL-mediated signaling pathways using Western blotting and other biochemical assays.
4. Examine the effects of ABL substrate knockdown or knockout on cell proliferation and differentiation using cell-based assays.
5. Analyze the data to determine if the knockdown or knockout of ABL substrates affects ABL-mediated signaling pathways and cellular processes.",
