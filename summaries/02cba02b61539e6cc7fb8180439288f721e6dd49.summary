"Title": "Investigating the effect of belimumab on renal outcomes in lupus nephritis patients",
"Objective": "To determine whether belimumab treatment improves renal outcomes in lupus nephritis patients by reducing B cell hyperactivity and type-I interferon expression",
"Methods": [
"Enroll 50 lupus nephritis patients and randomly assign them to receive belimumab or standard of care treatment",
"Collect blood and urine samples at baseline, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months",
"Measure B cell subsets, type-I interferon expression, and renal function using flow cytometry, ELISA, and serum creatinine levels, respectively",
"Compare renal outcomes between the belimumab and standard of care groups at 36 months",
"Equipment": [
"Flow cytometer",
"ELISA reader",
"Automated chemistry analyzer"
