"TITLE": "Immunotherapy-resistant acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells exhibit reduced CD19 and CD22 expression and BTK pathway dependency",
"YEAR": 2024,
"KEY FINDINGS": "CD19-resistant B-ALL cells have reduced CD19 and CD22 expression, and maintain BTK expression, which is functionally relevant in activating downstream proliferative MEK pathways.",
"MAIN RESULT": "Inhibition of the BCR and MEK pathways in patients with CD19-resistant B-ALL could be a therapeutically advantageous avenue for treatment.",
"HYPOTHESIS": "Targeting BTK and MEK pathways in combination with CD19-targeted therapies could prevent or overcome resistance in B-ALL patients.",
"EXPERIMENT": {
"Title": "Combination therapy with CD19-targeted immunotoxin and BTK/MEK inhibitors in B-ALL cells",
"Objective": "To investigate the efficacy of combination therapy with CD19-targeted immunotoxin and BTK/MEK inhibitors in B-ALL cells",
"Equipment": "CD19-targeted immunotoxin, BTK inhibitor (ibrutinib), MEK inhibitor (trametinib), B-ALL cell lines (NALM6, REH), cell culture media, FACS analyzer, Western blot equipment",
"Steps": [
"1. Culture B-ALL cell lines (NALM6, REH) in the presence of CD19-targeted immunotoxin, BTK inhibitor (ibrutinib), and MEK inhibitor (trametinib) alone or in combination.",
"2. Analyze cell viability and proliferation using FACS analyzer.",
"3. Perform Western blot analysis to assess BTK and MEK phosphorylation.",
"4. Compare the efficacy of combination therapy with single-agent therapy in reducing cell viability and phosphorylation of BTK and MEK."
