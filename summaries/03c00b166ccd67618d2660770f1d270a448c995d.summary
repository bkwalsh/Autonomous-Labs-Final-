"TITLE": "Flow Cytometric-Based Analysis of Defects in Lymphocyte Differentiation and Function Due to Inborn Errors of Immunity",
"YEAR": 2019,
"KEY FINDINGS": "The paper reviews the use of flow cytometry in the diagnosis and study of primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) and highlights its importance in understanding the pathophysiology of these disorders.",
"MAIN RESULT": "Flow cytometry has revolutionized the diagnosis and study of PIDs, enabling the identification of distinct lymphocyte populations and the detection of defects in lymphocyte differentiation and function.",
"HYPOTHESIS": "The use of flow cytometry can identify novel biomarkers for PIDs, enabling earlier diagnosis and more targeted treatment.",
"EXPERIMENT": {
"Title": "Identification of Novel Biomarkers for PIDs using Flow Cytometry",
"Objective": "To identify novel biomarkers for PIDs using flow cytometry and validate their diagnostic potential.",
"Equipment": "Flow cytometer, antibodies against various cell surface markers, PBMCs from healthy donors and PID patients",
"Steps": [
"1. Collect PBMCs from healthy donors and PID patients",
"2. Stain PBMCs with antibodies against various cell surface markers",
"3. Analyze stained cells using flow cytometry",
"4. Identify novel biomarkers that distinguish PID patients from healthy donors",
"5. Validate the diagnostic potential of identified biomarkers using a larger cohort of patients"
