"TITLE": "TRANSCRIPTOME ANALYSIS OF PERIPHERAL BLOOD AND RENAL TISSUE IDENTIFIES GENES THAT PREDICT TREATMENT RESPONSE IN PROLIFERATIVE LUPUS NEPHRITIS: A PROSPECTIVE OBSERVATIONAL STUDY",
"YEAR": 2024,
"KEY FINDINGS": "The study identified genes that predict treatment response in proliferative lupus nephritis (LN) by analyzing transcriptome data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and renal tissues. The study found that type I IFN and fibrosis pathways were enriched in non-responders (NR) and downregulated in clinical responders (CR) and flare (FL) groups.",
"MAIN RESULT": "The study identified baseline PBMC markers TENM2, NLGN1, and AP005230.1 that predicted NR and FL, and AP005230.1 from PBMCs and renal tissue predicted NR.",
"HYPOTHESIS": "The expression of genes involved in type I IFN and fibrosis pathways in PBMCs and renal tissues can predict treatment response in proliferative LN.",
"EXPERIMENT": "To validate this hypothesis, a prospective study can be designed to collect PBMCs and renal tissue samples from treatment-naive proliferative LN patients at baseline and after treatment. RNA sequencing can be performed to analyze the expression of genes involved in type I IFN and fibrosis pathways. The expression levels of these genes can be correlated with treatment response, and ROC analysis can be performed to evaluate the predictive power of these genes. Required equipment: RNA sequencing platform (e.g. Illumina Novaseq-6000), bioinformatics tools (e.g. Reactome database, WGCNA), and statistical software (e.g. RStudio). Steps to follow: 1) Collect PBMCs and renal tissue samples from treatment-naive proliferative LN patients at baseline and after treatment. 2) Extract RNA from the samples and perform RNA sequencing. 3) Analyze the expression of genes involved in type I IFN and fibrosis pathways using bioinformatics tools. 4) Correlate the expression levels of these genes with treatment response. 5) Perform ROC analysis to evaluate the predictive power of these genes.",
