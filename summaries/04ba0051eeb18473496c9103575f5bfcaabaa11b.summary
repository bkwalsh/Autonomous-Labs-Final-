"TITLE": "Repertoire Sequencing of B Cells Elucidates the Role of UNG and Mismatch Repair Proteins in Somatic Hypermutation in Humans",
"YEAR": 2019,
"KEY FINDINGS": "Patients with UNG, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 deficiency have reduced frequency and altered patterns of somatic hypermutation (SHM) in line with a five-pathway model to generate SHM. Trans-species comparison identifies differences in strand targeting of SHM between man and mice.",
"MAIN RESULT": "The study shows that UNG, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 play a role in the generation of SHM in humans, similar to their function in mice, but with differences in strand targeting.",
"HYPOTHESIS": "The Pms2/Mlh1 complex provides the nick required for AT mutagenesis and in the absence of the Pms2/Mlh1 complex, Ung can compensate for its function.",
"EXPERIMENT": {
"Title": "Validation of Pms2/Mlh1 complex function in AT mutagenesis",
"Objective": "To investigate the role of Pms2/Mlh1 complex in AT mutagenesis and its compensation by Ung",
"Equipment": "Next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform, B cells from Pms2/Mlh1-deficient mice, Ung-deficient mice, and wild-type mice",
"Steps": [
"1. Isolate B cells from Pms2/Mlh1-deficient mice, Ung-deficient mice, and wild-type mice",
"2. Perform NGS of the B cell receptor (BCR) heavy chain (IGHG and IGHA transcripts) from each group",
"3. Analyze the SHM patterns and mutation spectra using ARGalaxy",
"4. Compare the results between the three groups to determine the role of Pms2/Mlh1 complex in AT mutagenesis and its compensation by Ung"
