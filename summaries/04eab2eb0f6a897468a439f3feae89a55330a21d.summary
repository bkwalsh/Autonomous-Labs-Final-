"TITLE": "Surface Ig variable domain glycosylation affects autoantigen binding and acts as threshold for human autoreactive B cell activation",
"YEAR": 2022,
"KEY FINDINGS": "The study found that variable domain glycans (VDGs) on autoantibodies in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients affect autoantigen binding and act as a threshold for human autoreactive B cell activation. VDGs are positioned near the antigen-binding pocket and can mask binding to self-antigens, leading to enhanced B cell activation.",
"MAIN RESULT": "VDGs on autoantibodies in RA patients play a regulatory role in B cell activation and autoantigen binding.",
"HYPOTHESIS": "The presence of VDGs on autoreactive B cells may contribute to the breach of tolerance in RA by altering the threshold of B cell activation and allowing autoreactive B cells to escape negative selection.",
"EXPERIMENT": "To validate this hypothesis, an experiment could be designed to test the effect of VDGs on B cell activation in the presence of self-antigens. The experiment would require:

* Isolation of autoreactive B cells from RA patients and healthy controls
* Generation of VDG-expressing and non-VDG-expressing B cell receptors using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing
* Co-culture of VDG-expressing and non-VDG-expressing B cells with self-antigens and measurement of B cell activation markers (e.g. CD69, CD86)
* Use of flow cytometry and confocal microscopy to analyze B cell activation and antigen binding
* Statistical analysis to compare the activation of VDG-expressing and non-VDG-expressing B cells in response to self-antigens

Required equipment: CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system, flow cytometer, confocal microscope, cell culture facilities.",
