"TITLE": "Impaired B cell function during viral infections due to PTEN-mediated inhibition of the PI3K pathway",
"YEAR": 2017,
"KEY FINDINGS": "B cells from mice infected with gammaherpesvirus 68 (γHV68) have suppressed PI3K signaling, which is associated with elevated expression of the inositol phosphatase PTEN. PTEN-deficient B cells are insensitive to infection-induced B cell suppression, and constitutively active PI3K rescues the ability of B cells to mount antibody responses in infected mice.",
"MAIN RESULT": "PTEN up-regulation is responsible for the suppression of antibody responses in B cells during acute viral infection.",
"HYPOTHESIS": "PTEN up-regulation is a common mechanism by which various viral infections induce suppression of antibody responses.",
"EXPERIMENT": {
"Title": "Validation of PTEN up-regulation as a common mechanism of antibody response suppression during viral infections",
"Objective": "To determine if PTEN up-regulation is a common mechanism of antibody response suppression during various viral infections.",
"Equipment": "Mice, viral strains (e.g. γHV68, MCMV, FV), antibodies, flow cytometer, Western blotting equipment, ELISPOT assay kit",
"Steps": [
"1. Infect mice with different viral strains (e.g. γHV68, MCMV, FV) and harvest B cells at various time points.",
"2. Analyze PTEN expression in B cells by Western blotting and flow cytometry.",
"3. Determine antibody responses using ELISPOT assay.",
"4. Compare PTEN expression and antibody responses between infected and uninfected mice.",
"5. Correlate PTEN up-regulation with suppression of antibody responses across different viral infections."
