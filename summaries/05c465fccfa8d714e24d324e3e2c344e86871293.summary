"TITLE": "Ibex: Variational autoencoder for single-cell BCR sequencing",
"YEAR": 2023,
"KEY FINDINGS": "The paper presents Ibex, a novel R package that uses variational autoencoders to encode B cell receptor (BCR) sequences into a lower-dimensional latent space, enabling the integration of BCR sequences with single-cell RNA sequencing data.",
"MAIN RESULT": "Ibex can accurately encode BCR sequences and integrate them with single-cell RNA sequencing data, allowing for the identification of clonal lineages and the analysis of B cell development and function.",
"HYPOTHESIS": "The use of Ibex to integrate BCR sequences with single-cell RNA sequencing data can reveal novel insights into the development and function of B cells in health and disease.",
"EXPERIMENT": {
"Title": "Validating Ibex for B cell development and function",
"Objective": "To validate the use of Ibex for integrating BCR sequences with single-cell RNA sequencing data and to identify novel insights into B cell development and function.",
"Equipment": "Single-cell RNA sequencing platform, BCR sequencing platform, Ibex R package, computational resources for data analysis.",
"Steps": [
"1. Isolate B cells from healthy donors and patients with B cell-related disorders.",
"2. Perform single-cell RNA sequencing and BCR sequencing on the isolated B cells.",
"3. Use Ibex to encode the BCR sequences and integrate them with the single-cell RNA sequencing data.",
"4. Analyze the integrated data using dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g. UMAP) and clustering algorithms to identify novel patterns and correlations.",
"5. Validate the findings using functional assays (e.g. cell sorting, flow cytometry) and compare to existing knowledge of B cell development and function."
