"TITLE": "Targeting the ER-Mitochondrial Interface of Cell Death Sensitizes Leukemia Cells Towards Cytostatics",
"YEAR": 2017,
"KEY FINDINGS": "The protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) inhibitor PS89 sensitizes acute leukemia cells to chemotherapy by targeting the ER-mitochondrial interface, leading to apoptosis induction. PS89 targets a network of ER homeostasis proteins, including BAP31, which transduces apoptosis signals at the ER-mitochondrial interface.",
"MAIN RESULT": "PS89 synergizes with chemotherapy to induce apoptosis in acute leukemia cells, including drug-resistant cells and patient-derived xenograft cells.",
"HYPOTHESIS": "Targeting the ER-mitochondrial interface with PS89 can overcome chemotherapy resistance in acute leukemia by amplifying pro-apoptotic signaling loops.",
"EXPERIMENT": {
"Title": "Validation of PS89-mediated ER-mitochondrial interface targeting in chemotherapy-resistant acute leukemia cells",
"Objective": "To investigate whether PS89 can overcome chemotherapy resistance in acute leukemia cells by targeting the ER-mitochondrial interface.",
"Equipment": "Flow cytometer, confocal microscope, Western blot equipment, cell culture facilities",
"Steps": [
"1. Culture chemotherapy-resistant acute leukemia cells (e.g. Jurkat cells) with or without PS89 and chemotherapy (e.g. etoposide).",
"2. Analyze apoptosis induction using flow cytometry and Western blotting for caspase-3 and PARP cleavage.",
"3. Investigate ER-mitochondrial interface disruption using confocal microscopy and co-staining for ER and mitochondrial markers.",
"4. Measure mitochondrial membrane potential and cytosolic calcium levels using flow cytometry and fluorescent dyes.",
"5. Validate the role of BAP31 in PS89-mediated apoptosis induction using siRNA knockdown and co-immunoprecipitation assays."
