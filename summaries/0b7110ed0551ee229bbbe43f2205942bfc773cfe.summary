"TITLE": "B cell maturation antigenâ€“specific CAR T cells are clinically active in multiple myeloma",
"YEAR": 2019,
"KEY FINDINGS": "The study reports the results of a phase I clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of autologous T cells expressing a fully human BCMA-specific CAR (CART-BCMA) in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. The trial showed that CART-BCMA infusions with or without lymphodepleting chemotherapy are clinically active in heavily pretreated patients with multiple myeloma.",
"MAIN RESULT": "The overall response rate was 48%, with 12 of 25 patients responding to treatment, including 5 partial responses, 5 very good partial responses, 1 complete response, and 1 stringent complete response.",
"HYPOTHESIS": "The study suggests that the efficacy of CART-BCMA therapy may be associated with the expansion and persistence of CART-BCMA cells, as well as the induction of a Th1-biased immune response.",
"EXPERIMENT": "To validate this hypothesis, a follow-up study could investigate the correlation between CART-BCMA cell expansion and persistence, Th1 cytokine production, and clinical response in a larger cohort of patients. The experiment would require:
* Blood samples from patients treated with CART-BCMA
* Flow cytometry to quantify CART-BCMA cells and Th1 cytokine-producing T cells
* ELISA or multiplex assays to measure Th1 cytokine levels
* Statistical analysis to correlate CART-BCMA cell expansion and persistence with Th1 cytokine production and clinical response",
