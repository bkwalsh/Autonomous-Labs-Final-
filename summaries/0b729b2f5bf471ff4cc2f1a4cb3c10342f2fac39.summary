"TITLE": "The early activation of memory B cells from Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome patients is suppressed by CD19 downregulation",
"YEAR": 2016,
"KEY FINDINGS": "Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) patients exhibit defective memory B-cell responses, and WAS memory B cells show reduced B-cell spreading and BCR clustering upon antigen stimulation, which is associated with decreased CD19 recruitment and Btk activation, and increased FcgRIIB-SHIP-mediated negative signaling.",
"MAIN RESULT": "WASP is required for memory B-cell activation, promoting CD19 transcription and CD19 recruitment to the BCR.",
"HYPOTHESIS": "WASP regulates CD19 transcription by binding to a specific promoter region, leading to increased CD19 expression and recruitment to the BCR in memory B cells.",
"EXPERIMENT": {
"Title": "ChIP-seq analysis of WASP binding to the CD19 promoter region",
"Objective": "To determine if WASP binds to the CD19 promoter region and regulates its transcription.",
"Equipment": "ChIP-seq platform, antibodies against WASP and CD19, B cells from WAS patients and healthy controls",
"Steps": [
"1. Isolate B cells from WAS patients and healthy controls",
"2. Perform ChIP-seq using antibodies against WASP and CD19",
"3. Analyze ChIP-seq data to identify WASP binding sites in the CD19 promoter region",
"4. Validate WASP binding to the CD19 promoter region using qPCR and Western blot",
"5. Overexpress WASP in WAS B cells and measure CD19 expression and recruitment to the BCR"
