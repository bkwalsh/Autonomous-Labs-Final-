"TITLE": "Integration of B-cell receptor-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and mutations of SF3B1 gene refines prognosis in treatment-na√Øve chronic lymphocytic leukemia",
"YEAR": 2017,
"KEY FINDINGS": "The study found that integrating dynamic ERK1/2 phosphorylation and SF3B1 mutational status improves the prognostic potential of pERK1/2 and SF3B1 alone and identifies three groups of patients with distinct risks of disease progression.",
"MAIN RESULT": "The study identified three independent prognostic categories: a low-risk group, an intermediate-risk group, and a high-risk group, based on ERK1/2 phosphorylation and SF3B1 mutations.",
"HYPOTHESIS": "SF3B1 mutations may induce alternative splicing of the BCR component CD79b, leading to altered BCR expression and function in CLL.",
"EXPERIMENT": {
"Title": "Investigating the effect of SF3B1 mutations on CD79b splicing in CLL",
"Objective": "To determine if SF3B1 mutations lead to alternative splicing of CD79b in CLL cells.",
"Equipment": "RT-PCR, DNA sequencing, CLL cell lines with SF3B1 mutations and wild-type controls",
"Steps": [
"1. Isolate RNA from CLL cell lines with SF3B1 mutations and wild-type controls.",
"2. Perform RT-PCR to amplify CD79b transcripts.",
"3. Sequence the amplified transcripts to identify alternative splicing patterns.",
"4. Compare the splicing patterns between SF3B1-mutated and wild-type cells.",
"5. Validate the results using Western blotting to detect CD79b protein expression."
