"TITLE": "Novel modular chimeric antigen receptor spacer for T cells derived from signal regulatory protein alpha Ig-like domains",
"YEAR": 2022,
"KEY FINDINGS": "The study designed and tested novel chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) with spacers derived from signal-regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα) Ig-like domains, which showed equivalent cytotoxic functionality to traditional IgG1-based CARs but evaded off-target interactions with FcR-expressing myeloid cells.",
"MAIN RESULT": "The SIRPα-based CARs demonstrated potent in vitro cytotoxicity against CD19 positive B-lineage leukemia cells, comparable to traditional IgG1-based CAR T cells, while avoiding unwanted interactions with FcR-expressing myeloid cells.",
"HYPOTHESIS": "The SIRPα-based CARs may be more effective in vivo due to reduced off-target interactions, leading to improved anti-tumor activity and reduced side effects.",
"EXPERIMENT": "To validate this hypothesis, a xenograft mouse model of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) could be used. Mice would be engrafted with human B-ALL cells and then treated with either SIRPα-based CAR T cells or traditional IgG1-based CAR T cells. Tumor burden, CAR T cell persistence, and cytokine profiles would be monitored over time. Required equipment: xenograft mouse model, human B-ALL cells, SIRPα-based CAR T cells, traditional IgG1-based CAR T cells, flow cytometer, ELISA or cytokine bead array.",
