"TITLE": "Targeted-Lymphoma Drug Delivery System Based on the Sgc8-c Aptamer",
"YEAR": 2023,
"KEY FINDINGS": "The Sgc8-c-carb-da aptamer-drug conjugate specifically inhibited lymphocyte growth, produced cell death, caused cell proliferation arrest, and affected mitochondrial potential in A20 lymphoma cells.",
"MAIN RESULT": "Sgc8-c-carb-da showed higher (2.5-fold) cytotoxic effects than dasatinib in an in vitro cell-directed assay that mimics in vivo conditions.",
"HYPOTHESIS": "The Sgc8-c aptamer can be used to deliver other anti-cancer drugs to lymphoma cells, increasing their efficacy and reducing side effects.",
"EXPERIMENT": {
"Title": "Delivery of Doxorubicin by Sgc8-c Aptamer to Lymphoma Cells",
"Objective": "To evaluate the efficacy of Sgc8-c aptamer in delivering doxorubicin to lymphoma cells and enhancing its anti-cancer activity.",
"Equipment": "Sgc8-c aptamer, doxorubicin, A20 lymphoma cells, cell culture medium, MTT assay kit, flow cytometer.",
"Steps": [
"1. Synthesize Sgc8-c-doxorubicin conjugate using a similar method to Sgc8-c-carb-da.",
"2. Incubate A20 lymphoma cells with Sgc8-c-doxorubicin conjugate and doxorubicin alone at various concentrations.",
"3. Evaluate cell viability using MTT assay and compare the IC50 values.",
"4. Analyze cell death, cell proliferation arrest, and mitochondrial potential using flow cytometry and compare the results with doxorubicin alone."
