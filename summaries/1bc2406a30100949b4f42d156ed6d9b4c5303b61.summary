"TITLE": "ViCloD, an interactive web tool for visualizing B cell repertoires and analyzing intraclonal diversities: application to human B-cell tumors",
"YEAR": 2023,
"KEY FINDINGS": "The paper presents a novel web-based tool, ViCloD, for visualizing and analyzing B cell repertoires and intraclonal diversities. The tool is applied to human B-cell tumors, specifically follicular lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The authors demonstrate the tool's ability to identify and characterize clonal lineages, including their abundance, IGHV and IGHJ gene annotations, and CDR3 segment sequences.",
"MAIN RESULT": "The main result of the paper is the development and application of ViCloD, a user-friendly web tool for analyzing B cell repertoires and intraclonal diversities in human B-cell tumors.",
"HYPOTHESIS": "The paper proposes that the analysis of intraclonal diversities using ViCloD can identify specific clonal lineages associated with disease progression or treatment response in B-cell tumors.",
"EXPERIMENT": "To validate this hypothesis, an experiment could be designed as follows:

Title: Investigating the association between clonal lineages and disease progression in B-cell tumors using ViCloD

Objective: To identify specific clonal lineages associated with disease progression or treatment response in B-cell tumors using ViCloD.

Equipment:

* ViCloD web tool
* B-cell tumor samples from patients with follicular lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia
* High-throughput sequencing data (e.g. Illumina MiSeq)

Steps:

1. Collect B-cell tumor samples from patients with follicular lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
2. Perform high-throughput sequencing of the B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoire.
3. Upload the sequencing data to ViCloD and analyze the BCR repertoire and intraclonal diversities.
4. Identify specific clonal lineages associated with disease progression or treatment response using ViCloD.
5. Validate the findings using additional experiments, such as flow cytometry or functional assays.
