"TITLE": "Expanding the toolkit for the study of allo-specific B and T cell responses",
"YEAR": 2017,
"KEY FINDINGS": "The paper reviews various methods to detect alloreactive B and T cells, including mixed lymphocyte reactions, in vivo mouse models, trans-vivo delayed type hypersensitivity, and quantification of donor-specific antibody. It also discusses new tools such as intravital imaging, in vivo tracking of immune cells, and use of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) multimers.",
"MAIN RESULT": "The paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current methods and emerging technologies for studying alloimmune responses, highlighting their advantages and limitations.",
"HYPOTHESIS": "The use of retrogenic TCRs and MHC multimers can improve the accuracy of diagnostic tests for alloimmune responses and enable the tracking of antigen-specific B and T cells in vivo.",
"EXPERIMENT": "To validate this hypothesis, an experiment could be designed to compare the accuracy of traditional diagnostic tests with those using retrogenic TCRs and MHC multimers. The experiment would require:

* Retrogenic TCRs and MHC multimers with specificities for known alloantigens
* Mouse models with defined alloantigen and Tg alloreactive TCRs
* Flow cytometry and imaging equipment for tracking and sorting T cells
* Patient samples with known HLA types and alloimmune responses

Steps to follow:

1. Generate retrogenic TCRs and MHC multimers with specificities for known alloantigens.
2. Use these reagents to track and sort T cells from mouse models with defined alloantigen and Tg alloreactive TCRs.
3. Compare the accuracy of traditional diagnostic tests with those using retrogenic TCRs and MHC multimers in detecting alloimmune responses in patient samples.
4. Analyze the data to determine the sensitivity and specificity of each method.",
