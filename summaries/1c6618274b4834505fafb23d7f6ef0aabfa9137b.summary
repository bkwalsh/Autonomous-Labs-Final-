"TITLE": "Microenvironmental network of clonal CXCL13+CD4+ T cells and Tregs in pemphigus chronic blisters",
"YEAR": 2023,
"KEY FINDINGS": "The study found that skin tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) are associated with the persistence of chronically recurrent blisters in patients with pemphigus, and the microenvironmental network involving CXCL13+CD4+ T cells and Tregs within these structures plays an important role in CXCL13 production.",
"MAIN RESULT": "The study demonstrated the presence of skin TLSs with desmoglein-specific B cells in chronic blisters from patients with pemphigus, and identified CXCL13+CD4+ T cells as the major CXCL13-producing cells in skin TLSs.",
"HYPOTHESIS": "The CXCL13+CD4+ T cells in skin TLSs of pemphigus patients are regulated by Tregs through direct cell-cell contact, leading to the production of CXCL13 and the maintenance of chronic blisters.",
"EXPERIMENT": "To validate this hypothesis, an experiment can be designed to investigate the effect of Treg depletion on CXCL13 production in skin TLSs of pemphigus patients. The experiment would require the following steps:

1. Isolate skin TLSs from pemphigus patients and sort CXCL13+CD4+ T cells and Tregs using flow cytometry.
2. Co-culture CXCL13+CD4+ T cells with Tregs or without Tregs in the presence of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies to stimulate T cell activation.
3. Measure CXCL13 production in the co-culture supernatants using ELISA.
4. Deplete Tregs from the co-culture using anti-CD25 antibodies and measure CXCL13 production again.
5. Analyze the data to determine if Treg depletion leads to a decrease in CXCL13 production.

Required equipment: flow cytometer, cell sorter, ELISA plate reader, antibodies (anti-CD3, anti-CD28, anti-CD25).",
