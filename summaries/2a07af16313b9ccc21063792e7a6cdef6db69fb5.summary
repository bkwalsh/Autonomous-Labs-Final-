"TITLE": "Blockade of Y177 and Nuclear Translocation of Bcr-Abl Inhibits Proliferation and Promotes Apoptosis in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Cells",
"YEAR": 2017,
"KEY FINDINGS": "The study demonstrates the construction of a nuclear transport system that can direct Bcr-Abl from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, inhibiting CML cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis.",
"MAIN RESULT": "The nuclear transport system inhibits CML cell proliferation through MAPK and STAT5 pathways and promotes apoptosis by activating p73 and its downstream molecules.",
"HYPOTHESIS": "The nuclear translocation of Bcr-Abl can induce apoptosis in CML cells by disrupting the interaction between Bcr-Abl and its downstream effectors, leading to the inhibition of pro-survival pathways.",
"EXPERIMENT": {
"Title": "Validation of the hypothesis using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing",
"Objective": "To investigate the effect of nuclear translocation of Bcr-Abl on its interaction with downstream effectors and pro-survival pathways in CML cells.",
"Equipment": "CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing system, K562 cells, Western blot, co-immunoprecipitation assay",
"Steps": [
"1. Design and construct CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNAs targeting the nuclear localization signals of Bcr-Abl.",
"2. Transfect K562 cells with the CRISPR-Cas9 plasmid and select for edited cells.",
"3. Verify the nuclear translocation of Bcr-Abl using Western blot and immunofluorescence.",
"4. Perform co-immunoprecipitation assays to investigate the interaction between Bcr-Abl and its downstream effectors (e.g. Grb2, STAT5).",
"5. Analyze the expression of pro-survival genes (e.g. Bcl-2, Mcl-1) using Western blot and qRT-PCR."
