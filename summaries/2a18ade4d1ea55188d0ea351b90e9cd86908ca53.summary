"TITLE": "B-cell receptorâ€“driven MALT1 activity regulates MYC signaling in mantle cell lymphoma",
"YEAR": 2017,
"KEY FINDINGS": "MALT1 is expressed and activated in a subset of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cases, and its inhibition induces cytotoxicity in MCL cells. MALT1 regulates MYC protein stability, and MYC is essential for MCL survival.",
"MAIN RESULT": "MALT1 activity is required for the survival of a subset of MCL cells, and its inhibition leads to decreased MYC protein levels and subsequent cell death.",
"HYPOTHESIS": "Inhibition of MALT1 activity may be a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of MCL, particularly in cases with high MALT1 activity.",
"EXPERIMENT": {
"Title": "Validation of MALT1 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for MCL",
"Objective": "To investigate the efficacy of MALT1 inhibition in reducing tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model of MCL.",
"Equipment": "MALT1 inhibitor (z-VRPR-fmk), MCL cell lines, mouse xenograft model, Western blotting equipment, cell viability assay equipment.",
"Steps": [
"1. Establish a mouse xenograft model of MCL using MALT1-activated MCL cell lines.",
"2. Treat the mice with z-VRPR-fmk or vehicle control.",
"3. Monitor tumor growth and measure MALT1 activity and MYC protein levels in tumor biopsies.",
"4. Perform Western blotting and cell viability assays to confirm the effects of MALT1 inhibition on MYC protein levels and cell survival."
