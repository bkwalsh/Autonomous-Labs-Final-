"TITLE": "Visualizing the Actin and Microtubule Cytoskeletons at the B-cell Immune Synapse Using Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) Microscopy",
"YEAR": 2018,
"KEY FINDINGS": "The paper describes a method for using STED microscopy to simultaneously image actin structures, microtubules, and transfected GFP-tagged microtubule plus-end binding proteins in B cells. The method allows for high-resolution imaging of the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons at the immune synapse.",
"MAIN RESULT": "The paper demonstrates the ability to visualize the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons at the immune synapse using STED microscopy, providing new insights into the mechanisms of immune synapse formation.",
"HYPOTHESIS": "The coordinated reorganization of the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons is crucial for the formation of a functional immune synapse.",
"EXPERIMENT": "To validate this hypothesis, an experiment could be designed to disrupt the interaction between the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons using RNA interference or dominant-negative mutants, and then use STED microscopy to visualize the effects on immune synapse formation. Required equipment: STED microscope, RNA interference or dominant-negative mutants, B cells, anti-Ig antibodies, and image analysis software. Steps: 1) Transfect B cells with RNA interference or dominant-negative mutants targeting the interaction between actin and microtubule cytoskeletons. 2) Allow B cells to spread on anti-Ig-coated coverslips. 3) Fix and immunostain the cells. 4) Use STED microscopy to image the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons. 5) Analyze the images to determine the effects of disrupting the interaction on immune synapse formation.",
