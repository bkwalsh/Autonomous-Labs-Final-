"TITLE": "Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with concurrent high MYC and BCL2 expression shows evidence of active B-cell receptor signaling by quantitative immunofluorescence",
"YEAR": 2017,
"KEY FINDINGS": "The study found that diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with concurrent high MYC and BCL2 expression, known as double-expressor lymphoma (DEL), shows evidence of active B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling, which may represent a rational therapeutic target in this aggressive subgroup of DLBCL.",
"MAIN RESULT": "The study demonstrated a positive correlation between DEL and markers of activated BCR signaling, including phosphorylated BCR-associated kinases SYK, LYN, and BTK, and nuclear exclusion of forkhead transcription factor FOXO1.",
"HYPOTHESIS": "Targeting BCR signaling may be an effective therapeutic strategy for DEL, a subgroup of DLBCL with poor prognosis.",
"EXPERIMENT": {
"Title": "Inhibition of BCR signaling in DEL cell lines",
"Objective": "To investigate the effect of BCR signaling inhibition on cell viability and proliferation in DEL cell lines.",
"Equipment": "DEL cell lines, BCR signaling inhibitors (e.g. ibrutinib), cell viability assays (e.g. MTT), flow cytometry, western blotting.",
"Steps": [
"1. Culture DEL cell lines in vitro and treat with BCR signaling inhibitors at various concentrations.",
"2. Assess cell viability using MTT assays and flow cytometry.",
"3. Analyze protein expression and phosphorylation of BCR-associated kinases and downstream targets using western blotting.",
"4. Compare results to untreated controls and determine the effect of BCR signaling inhibition on DEL cell lines."
