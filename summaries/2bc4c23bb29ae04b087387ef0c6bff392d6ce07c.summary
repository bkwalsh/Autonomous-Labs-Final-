"TITLE": "Autofluorescence lifetime imaging classifies human lymphocyte activation and subtype",
"YEAR": 2023,
"KEY FINDINGS": "The study demonstrates that optical metabolic imaging (OMI) can classify human lymphocyte activation and subtype based on autofluorescence lifetime imaging of metabolic cofactors NAD(P)H and FAD.",
"MAIN RESULT": "The study shows that OMI can accurately classify B cells and NK cells according to activation state and subtype with high accuracy (up to 93.4% and 92.6%, respectively).",
"HYPOTHESIS": "OMI can be used to non-invasively monitor lymphocyte activation and subtype in real-time, enabling personalized immunotherapy and adoptive cell therapy.",
"EXPERIMENT": {
"Title": "Real-time OMI monitoring of lymphocyte activation",
"Objective": "To validate the hypothesis that OMI can non-invasively monitor lymphocyte activation and subtype in real-time.",
"Equipment": "OMI microscope, lymphocyte samples, activation stimuli (e.g. IL-4, IL-12, IL-15, IL-18), CD69 antibody",
"Steps": [
"1. Prepare lymphocyte samples and activate them with specific stimuli.",
"2. Perform OMI imaging of the lymphocytes at multiple time points during activation.",
"3. Analyze OMI data using machine learning algorithms to classify lymphocyte activation and subtype.",
"4. Validate the results using flow cytometry and other established methods."
