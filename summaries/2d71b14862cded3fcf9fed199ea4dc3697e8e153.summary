"TITLE": "Characterization of intratumoral tertiary lymphoid structures in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: cellular properties and prognostic significance",
"YEAR": 2023,
"KEY FINDINGS": "Intratumoral tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) were identified in 21.1% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients without preoperative treatment and 15.4% of patients with neoadjuvant treatment. The presence of intratumoral TLSs was associated with improved overall survival and progression-free survival in patients without preoperative treatment, but not in patients with neoadjuvant treatment.",
"MAIN RESULT": "The study found that intratumoral TLSs are associated with improved prognosis in PDAC patients without preoperative treatment, but not in patients with neoadjuvant treatment.",
"HYPOTHESIS": "Neoadjuvant chemotherapy may compromise the protective roles of intratumoral TLSs in PDAC patients.",
"EXPERIMENT": "To validate this hypothesis, a prospective study can be designed to compare the presence and characteristics of intratumoral TLSs in PDAC patients who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy versus those who do not. The study would require:

* A cohort of PDAC patients who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy and a cohort of patients who do not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy
* Tumor tissue samples from both cohorts
* Fluorescent multiplex immunohistochemistry analysis to identify and characterize intratumoral TLSs
* Comparison of the presence, size, and cellular composition of intratumoral TLSs between the two cohorts
* Correlation of intratumoral TLS characteristics with patient outcomes (e.g. overall survival, progression-free survival)

Required equipment:

* Fluorescent multiplex immunohistochemistry platform (e.g. Opal 7-Colour Manual IHC Kit)
* Image analysis software (e.g. inForm V.2.4, HALO V.3.2)
* Statistical analysis software (e.g. SPSS, R)",
