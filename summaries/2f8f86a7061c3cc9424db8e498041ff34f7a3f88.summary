"TITLE": "Rictor positively regulates B cell receptor signaling by modulating actin reorganization via ezrin",
"YEAR": 2017,
"KEY FINDINGS": "Rictor is involved in BCR activation, and its deficiency leads to reduced BCR signaling, impaired B cell development, and decreased humoral immune response. Rictor regulates BCR signaling by modulating actin reorganization via ezrin.",
"MAIN RESULT": "Rictor positively regulates BCR signaling by modulating actin reorganization via ezrin, which is essential for B cell activation and humoral immune response.",
"HYPOTHESIS": "Rictor regulates BCR signaling by modulating the activity of ezrin, which in turn affects the actin cytoskeleton and BCR mobility.",
"EXPERIMENT": {
"Title": "Validating the role of Rictor in regulating ezrin activity and BCR signaling",
"Objective": "To investigate whether Rictor regulates BCR signaling by modulating ezrin activity and actin reorganization.",
"Equipment": "Confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, western blot, and biochemical assays.",
"Steps": [
"1. Generate Rictor knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) B cells.",
"2. Stimulate B cells with soluble antigen (sAg) and measure BCR signaling using flow cytometry and western blot.",
"3. Use confocal microscopy to visualize and quantify the colocalization of BCR, ezrin, and actin in WT and Rictor KO B cells.",
"4. Perform biochemical assays to measure the activity of ezrin and its downstream effectors in WT and Rictor KO B cells.",
"5. Use pharmacological inhibitors or siRNA to modulate ezrin activity in WT and Rictor KO B cells and measure the effect on BCR signaling."
