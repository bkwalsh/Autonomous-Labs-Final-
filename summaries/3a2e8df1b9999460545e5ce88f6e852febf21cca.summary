"TITLE": "Combinatorial targeting of nuclear export and translation of RNA inhibits aggressive B-cell lymphomas",
"YEAR": 2016,
"KEY FINDINGS": "The paper identifies eIF4E as a key driver of aggressive B-cell lymphomas and shows that it regulates the nuclear export and translation of BCL6, MYC, and BCL2 mRNAs. TEHsp90, a stress active form of Hsp90, modulates eIF4E activity and is a novel partner protein in this process.",
"MAIN RESULT": "The paper demonstrates that combinatorial inhibition of eIF4E and TEHsp90 results in cooperative antilymphoma activity in DH/TH DLBCL in vitro and in vivo.",
"HYPOTHESIS": "Inhibiting eIF4E and TEHsp90 simultaneously will lead to a more effective treatment of aggressive B-cell lymphomas by disrupting the oncogenic network that sustains these cancers.",
"EXPERIMENT": {
"Title": "Validation of combinatorial inhibition of eIF4E and TEHsp90 in aggressive B-cell lymphomas",
"Objective": "To investigate the efficacy of combinatorial inhibition of eIF4E and TEHsp90 in aggressive B-cell lymphomas using a xenograft model.",
"Equipment": "SCID mice, DLBCL cell lines, ribavirin, PU-H71, eIF4E siRNA, TEHsp90 inhibitor, tumor volume measurement equipment.",
"Steps": [
"1. Establish a xenograft model of aggressive B-cell lymphoma in SCID mice using DLBCL cell lines.",
"2. Treat mice with ribavirin (eIF4E inhibitor), PU-H71 (TEHsp90 inhibitor), or a combination of both.",
"3. Measure tumor volume and compare between treatment groups.",
"4. Perform Western blot analysis to confirm inhibition of eIF4E and TEHsp90 in tumor samples.",
"5. Analyze the expression of BCL6, MYC, and BCL2 mRNAs in tumor samples using qRT-PCR."
