"TITLE": "Combination Immunotherapies: Amphiphile-Peptide Boosting with FMC63-Binding Surrogate Peptide Mimotopes Induces Activation and Potent Effector Function in CAR-T Cells Targeting CD19",
"YEAR": 2021,
"KEY FINDINGS": "The study demonstrates that CD19 mimotope peptides modified with Amphiphile (AMP) technology can effectively accumulate in lymph nodes, decorate endogenous antigen-presenting cells, and stimulate CAR-T cells to promote potent anti-tumor responses.",
"MAIN RESULT": "AMP-modified CD19 peptides can induce activation, cytotoxicity, and effector functions of CAR-T cells in vitro and in vivo.",
"HYPOTHESIS": "The AMP-modified CD19 peptides can enhance the persistence and anti-tumor activity of CAR-T cells in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies.",
"EXPERIMENT TO VALIDATE HYPOTHESIS": {
"Title": "In Vivo Evaluation of AMP-Modified CD19 Peptides in Combination with CAR-T Cell Therapy",
"Objective": "To evaluate the efficacy and persistence of CAR-T cells in combination with AMP-modified CD19 peptides in a murine model of B-cell lymphoma.",
"Equipment": "Murine B-cell lymphoma model, CAR-T cells, AMP-modified CD19 peptides, flow cytometer, bioluminescence imaging system.",
"Steps": [
"1. Establish a murine B-cell lymphoma model using luciferase-expressing tumor cells.",
"2. Engineer CAR-T cells to express FMC63-based CARs and administer them to the mice.",
"3. Co-administer AMP-modified CD19 peptides or soluble peptides as a control.",
"4. Monitor tumor growth and CAR-T cell expansion using bioluminescence imaging and flow cytometry.",
"5. Evaluate the persistence and anti-tumor activity of CAR-T cells using flow cytometry and tumor burden analysis."
