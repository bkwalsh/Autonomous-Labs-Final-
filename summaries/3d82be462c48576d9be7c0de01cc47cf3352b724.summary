"TITLE": "CD19-CD28: An affinity-optimized CD28 agonist for combination with glofitamab (CD20-TCB) as off-the-shelf immunotherapy",
"YEAR": 2021,
"KEY FINDINGS": "The paper reports the development of a CD19-targeted CD28 agonist (CD19-CD28) that enhances the efficacy of glofitamab, a CD20-targeted T cell bispecific antibody, in treating B cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (B NHL). CD19-CD28 provides costimulation to T cells without superagonistic properties, and its combination with glofitamab and the costimulatory 4-1BB agonist CD19-4-1BBL leads to improved long-term tumor control in humanized mice.",
"MAIN RESULT": "CD19-CD28 is a safe and highly efficacious off-the-shelf combination partner for glofitamab and similar TCBs, and its triple combination with CD19-4-1BBL offers substantially improved long-term tumor control over glofitamab monotherapy and respective duplet combinations.",
"HYPOTHESIS": "CD19-CD28 may enhance the efficacy of T cell bispecific antibodies by increasing the formation of immunological synapses between T cells and cancer cells, leading to improved T cell activation and tumor killing.",
"EXPERIMENT": "To validate this hypothesis, an experiment can be designed to visualize and quantify the formation of immunological synapses between T cells and cancer cells in the presence and absence of CD19-CD28. This can be achieved using confocal microscopy and 3D image processing. The required equipment includes a confocal microscope, antibodies against T cell and cancer cell surface markers, and image analysis software. The steps to follow are: 1) co-culture T cells and cancer cells with or without CD19-CD28, 2) stain the cells with antibodies against T cell and cancer cell surface markers, 3) image the cells using confocal microscopy, 4) analyze the images using 3D image processing software to quantify the formation of immunological synapses, and 5) compare the results between the presence and absence of CD19-CD28.",
