"TITLE": "Lactic acidosis impairs T cell killing activity by reducing T cell mobility and target cell attachment",
"YEAR": 2020,
"KEY FINDINGS": "Lactic acidosis inhibits IFN-g production and degranulation in T cells, and impairs T cell killing activity by reducing T cell mobility and target cell attachment",
"MAIN RESULT": "Lactic acidosis reduces T cell killing activity by impairing T cell mobility and target cell attachment",
"HYPOTHESIS": "Lactic acidosis impairs T cell killing activity by disrupting the formation of immunological synapses between T cells and target cells",
"EXPERIMENT": {
"Title": "Investigating the effect of lactic acidosis on immunological synapse formation",
"Equipment": "T cells, target cells, lactic acid, confocal microscopy, immunofluorescence staining",
