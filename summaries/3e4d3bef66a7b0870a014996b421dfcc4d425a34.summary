"TITLE": "CAR-T cells and TRUCKs that recognize an EBNA-3C-derived epitope presented on HLA-B*35 control Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferation",
"YEAR": 2020,
"KEY FINDINGS": "The study demonstrates the development of CAR-T cells and TRUCKs that specifically target EBV-infected B cells, recognizing an EBNA-3C-derived epitope presented on HLA-B*35. These cells show improved effector functions, including cytokine release and cytotoxicity, and can recruit and activate innate immune cells.",
"MAIN RESULT": "TÜ165 CAR-T cells and TRUCKs effectively target and eliminate EBV-infected B cells, while sparing healthy B cells, and can be used to control EBV-associated lymphoproliferation.",
"HYPOTHESIS": "The local release of IL-12 by TRUCKs can enhance the anti-tumor activity of CAR-T cells by recruiting and activating innate immune cells, leading to a more effective treatment of EBV-associated lymphoproliferation.",
"EXPERIMENT": "To validate this hypothesis, an in vitro co-culture experiment can be performed. TÜ165 TRUCKs, IL-12-deficient TRUCKs, and untransduced T cells can be co-cultured with EBV-infected B cells and innate immune cells (e.g., monocytes and NK cells) at different ratios. The release of cytokines (e.g., IFN-γ, TNF-α) and the killing of EBV-infected B cells can be measured. The experiment would require the following equipment: cell culture facilities, flow cytometer, ELISA or multiplex cytokine analysis, and a cell counting device. The steps to follow would be: 1) generate TÜ165 TRUCKs and IL-12-deficient TRUCKs, 2) co-culture TRUCKs with EBV-infected B cells and innate immune cells, 3) measure cytokine release and cell killing, 4) compare the results between TÜ165 TRUCKs and IL-12-deficient TRUCKs.",
