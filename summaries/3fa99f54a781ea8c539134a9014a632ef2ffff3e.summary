"TITLE": "Construction of an immune-related lncRNA signature as a novel prognosis biomarker for LUAD",
"YEAR": 2021,
"KEY FINDINGS": "The study identified a 6-lncRNA pair signature that can predict the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients. The signature was constructed by pairing immune-related lncRNAs regardless of expression level and was found to be an independent prognostic indicator for LUAD patients.",
"MAIN RESULT": "The 6-lncRNA pair signature was found to be a powerful predictor of LUAD prognosis, with high-risk patients having a worse prognosis than low-risk patients.",
"HYPOTHESIS": "The immune-related lncRNA signature can predict the response of LUAD patients to immunotherapy and chemotherapy.",
"EXPERIMENT": "To validate this hypothesis, a prospective study can be conducted where LUAD patients are divided into high-risk and low-risk groups based on the 6-lncRNA pair signature. The patients can then be treated with immunotherapy or chemotherapy, and their response to treatment can be monitored. The response to treatment can be correlated with the risk score to determine if the signature can predict treatment outcome. Required equipment: RNA sequencing platform, bioinformatics tools for data analysis, and clinical data collection tools. Steps to follow: 1) Collect RNA samples from LUAD patients, 2) Perform RNA sequencing to determine the expression levels of the 6-lncRNA pairs, 3) Calculate the risk score for each patient, 4) Divide patients into high-risk and low-risk groups, 5) Treat patients with immunotherapy or chemotherapy, 6) Monitor treatment response, 7) Correlate treatment response with risk score.",
