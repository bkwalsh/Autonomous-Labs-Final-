"TITLE": "Siglec-8 Signals Through a Non-Canonical Pathway to Cause Human Eosinophil Death In Vitro",
"YEAR": 2021,
"KEY FINDINGS": "Siglec-8 engagement on IL-5-primed human eosinophils induces cell death through a non-canonical pathway involving Src family kinases, Syk, SHIP1, and Btk, but not SHP-1/2, and requires actin rearrangement.",
"MAIN RESULT": "Siglec-8 signals through a non-canonical pathway to cause human eosinophil death, challenging the expectation that ITIM-bearing Siglecs signal through inhibitory pathways involving protein tyrosine phosphatases.",
"HYPOTHESIS": "Siglec-8 may interact with and activate Btk through a novel adapter protein, leading to the activation of downstream signaling molecules and ultimately cell death.",
"EXPERIMENT": {
"Title": "Co-immunoprecipitation of Siglec-8 and Btk with a novel adapter protein",
"Objective": "To identify a novel adapter protein that interacts with Siglec-8 and Btk, leading to the activation of Btk and downstream signaling molecules.",
"Equipment": "Eosinophils, Siglec-8 antibody, Btk antibody, novel adapter protein antibody, protein A/G beads, lysis buffer, western blot equipment",
"Steps": [
"1. Isolate eosinophils and prime them with IL-5.",
"2. Treat eosinophils with Siglec-8 antibody and lyse them.",
"3. Perform co-immunoprecipitation using Siglec-8 antibody, Btk antibody, and novel adapter protein antibody.",
"4. Analyze the immunoprecipitates by western blot for the presence of Siglec-8, Btk, and the novel adapter protein.",
"5. Validate the interaction by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry."
