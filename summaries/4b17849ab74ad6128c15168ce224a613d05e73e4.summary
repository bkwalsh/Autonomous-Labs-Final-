"TITLE": "Expression of the prosurvival kinase HCK requires PAX5 and mutated MYD88 signaling in MYD88-driven B-cell lymphomas",
"YEAR": 2020,
"KEY FINDINGS": "HCK expression is upregulated in MYD88-mutated B-cell lymphomas and is dependent on PAX5 and mutated MYD88 signaling. TLR/MYD88 signaling activates JunB, which regulates HCK expression.",
"MAIN RESULT": "HCK expression is regulated by PAX5, mutated MYD88, and downstream signaling molecules including STAT3, NF-kB, and AP-1 in MYD88-mutated B-cell lymphomas.",
"HYPOTHESIS": "Inhibition of JunB may be a therapeutic strategy to target HCK expression and survival in MYD88-mutated B-cell lymphomas.",
"EXPERIMENT": {
"Title": "Validation of JunB as a therapeutic target in MYD88-mutated B-cell lymphomas",
"Objective": "To investigate the effect of JunB inhibition on HCK expression and cell survival in MYD88-mutated B-cell lymphomas.",
"Equipment": "Lentiviral shRNA vectors, JunB shRNA, MYD88-mutated B-cell lymphoma cell lines (e.g. BCWM.1, MWCL-1), western blotting equipment, cell viability assays.",
"Steps": [
"1. Design and clone JunB shRNA into lentiviral vectors.",
"2. Transduce MYD88-mutated B-cell lymphoma cell lines with JunB shRNA or control shRNA.",
"3. Measure HCK protein levels by western blotting.",
"4. Perform cell viability assays to assess the effect of JunB inhibition on cell survival.",
"5. Analyze data to determine the effect of JunB inhibition on HCK expression and cell survival."
