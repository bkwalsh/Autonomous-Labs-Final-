"TITLE": "Interferon regulatory factor 8 regulates caspase-1 expression to facilitate Epstein-Barr virus reactivation in response to B cell receptor stimulation and chemical induction",
"YEAR": 2018,
"KEY FINDINGS": "IRF8 depletion inhibits EBV lytic replication, IRF8 regulates caspase-1 expression, caspase-1 is required for EBV reactivation, and IRF8-dependent caspase activation facilitates the degradation of cellular factors that limit EBV lytic replication",
"MAIN RESULT": "IRF8 regulates EBV lytic replication through caspase-1 expression and activation",
"HYPOTHESIS": "IRF8 regulates the expression of other caspases, in addition to caspase-1, to facilitate EBV lytic replication",
"EXPERIMENT": {
"Title": "Investigating the role of IRF8 in regulating other caspases during EBV lytic replication",
"Objective": "To determine if IRF8 regulates the expression of other caspases, in addition to caspase-1, during EBV lytic replication",
"Equipment": "CRISPR/Cas9 system, lentiviral vectors, Akata (EBV+) cells, antibodies against various caspases, Western blotting equipment",
"Steps": [
"1. Use CRISPR/Cas9 system to deplete IRF8 in Akata (EBV+) cells",
"2. Analyze the expression of various caspases (e.g. caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9) by Western blotting",
"3. Compare the expression levels of caspases between IRF8-depleted and control cells",
"4. Investigate the effect of IRF8 depletion on EBV lytic replication in the presence and absence of caspase inhibitors"
