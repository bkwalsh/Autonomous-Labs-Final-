"TITLE": "Association of the retinal vasculature, intrathecal immunity, and disability in multiple sclerosis",
"YEAR": 2022,
"KEY FINDINGS": "The study found that alterations of the retinal vasculature are linked to changes in the cellular and humoral immune compartment in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with early relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Retinal vessel loss was associated with higher frequencies of activated B cells and higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the CSF.",
"MAIN RESULT": "Retinal vessel loss was associated with future disability worsening in patients with RRMS.",
"HYPOTHESIS": "The retinal vasculature may serve as a biomarker for monitoring disease activity and predicting future disability in multiple sclerosis.",
"EXPERIMENT": {
"Title": "Validation of retinal vasculature as a biomarker for disease activity in multiple sclerosis",
"Objective": "To validate the association between retinal vessel loss and disease activity in multiple sclerosis.",
"Equipment": "Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) device, CSF analysis equipment, and clinical evaluation tools.",
"Steps": [
"Recruit patients with RRMS and healthy controls",
"Perform OCT-A analysis to assess retinal vessel density",
"Collect CSF samples and analyze for immune cell frequencies and cytokine levels",
"Perform clinical evaluations to assess disease activity and disability",
"Correlate OCT-A measures with CSF analysis and clinical evaluation results",
"Follow up patients over time to assess disease progression and validate the predictive value of retinal vessel loss"
