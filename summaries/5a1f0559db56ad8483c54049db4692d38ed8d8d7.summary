"TITLE": "The actin cytoskeleton regulates signaling",
"YEAR": 2016,
"KEY FINDINGS": "The actin cytoskeleton plays a critical role in regulating receptor signaling thresholds and integration of different signals through controlling molecular organization and dynamics of cell surface proteins.",
"MAIN RESULT": "The actin cytoskeleton is a key regulator of receptor signaling, and its dynamics and structural properties must be tightly regulated to fulfill its various functions in a multitude of cellular events.",
"HYPOTHESIS": "Modulation of the actin cytoskeleton is a general mechanism for integrating cross talk between different signaling pathways.",
"EXPERIMENT": {
"Title": "Investigating the role of actin cytoskeleton in receptor signaling",
"Objective": "To validate the hypothesis that modulation of the actin cytoskeleton is a general mechanism for integrating cross talk between different signaling pathways.",
"Equipment": "Fluorescence microscopy, cell culture facilities, actin-modulating drugs (e.g. cytochalasin D), receptor-specific antibodies, and signaling pathway-specific inhibitors.",
"Steps": [
"1. Culture cells expressing the receptor of interest and treat with actin-modulating drugs to alter actin cytoskeleton dynamics.",
"2. Use fluorescence microscopy to visualize receptor clustering and signaling pathway activation.",
"3. Use receptor-specific antibodies to quantify receptor clustering and signaling pathway-specific inhibitors to assess the effect of actin cytoskeleton modulation on signaling pathway cross talk.",
"4. Analyze the data to determine if modulation of the actin cytoskeleton affects receptor signaling and integration of different signaling pathways."
